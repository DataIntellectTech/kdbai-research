# Image Classification

This folder contains the work of Paul McVicker on image classification using KDB.AI. 

Initially users will work through the classification_doc.ipynb notebook. Note, this notebook will require a previously trained neaural network. If you have not done this you can train one using this [training notebook](https://github.com/DataIntellectTech/kdbai-research/blob/main/Image%20Search/Image_search/COVID_model_training.ipynb).
