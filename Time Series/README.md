# Time Series analysis and KDB.AI

This folder contains the source code for some applications of KDB.AI to [anomaly detection](https://dataintellect.com/blog/exploring-anomaly-detection-with-kdb-ai/) and [financial market data analysis](https://dataintellect.com/blog/market-data-analysis-with-kdb-ai/) developed by Sophie Loca. 

Some features to implement in the future:
* Set up the market data example using another vector database technology (e.g PineCone) 
* Combine unstructured data with timeseries analysis (example shown [here](https://kdb.ai/learning-hub/demos/pattern-similarity/))
